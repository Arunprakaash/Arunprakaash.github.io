      <description>Defensive Distillation is an implementation based on the seminal paper, enhancing the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks. This technique involves training a &amp;ldquo;student&amp;rdquo; model on perturbed data produced by a &amp;ldquo;teacher&amp;rdquo; model to improve defense against gradient-based attacks.
Key highlights include:
Utilizing TensorFlow and the MNIST dataset. Demonstrating increased resilience through distillation, with a slight trade-off in accuracy. Successfully defending against FGSM adversarial attacks.
